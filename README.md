# Homework-Assignment-1
Our first homework assignment for the UCSD Coding Bootcamp (due March 13th, 2021)


Fixes:

1) Fixed the broken <img></img> tag issue

2) Consolidated css sheet

3) Began having errors regarding the final image (social-media-marking.jpg).  For some reason it loads directly from my computer into my web browser (chrome).  The html seems okay.  But I have no idea why GitHub is not processing the image correctly.  Tried to compress the image to no avail.  But it seems like the rest of the index.html and style.css are working together fine.  All links are working and all other images load correctly.



STEPS/NOTES For Myself

1) HTML code is opening just fine in chrome via direct file open from laptop

2) However, the web page is not opening via c1griffi.github.io/Homework-Assignment-1

3) style sheet is called correctly ./assets/css/style.css

4) images are called correctly ./assets/images/…
    ⁃    Note some images are not loading separately on GitHub.

    ⁃    Found a (potentially broken) set of <img></img> tags (where there should only be one <img/> tag)
    ⁃    

5) Downloading entire repo from Github to open from laptop - just to see if there is a weird discrepancy between the downloaded files + the files already on my computer (despite the fact they’re supposed to already be linked

6) Figured it out - just skipped the Settings - Main Step***
